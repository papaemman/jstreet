Why docker?

- identical development environment
- this is a code competition so I need to avoid the "works on my machine" problem


Steps

1. Install the docker community edition 

2. Get kaggle docker image
$ docker pull gcr.io/kaggle-images/python:latest


3. 
$ docker run -it -v /home/myusername:/home/jovyan gcr.io/kaggle-images/python /bin/bash


4. Get the dataset using kaggle API

you need to get your kaggle.json token from your Profile. 
This file needs to go into ~/.kaggle/; i.e., mkdir ~/.kaggle and copy the file there
then to get the data, you need to pip install kaggle for the CLI

5. Create the correct project structure to match the Kaggle environment

You'll want the paths locally to match the kernel paths 
(i.e., you want code that says train_data = pd.read_csv('../input/...') that works in the Kaggle kernel to also work locally).

For that you can do something like
$ mkdir -p input
$ kaggle competitions download -c jane-street-market-prediction -p input
$ unzip -o input/*.zip -d input

lastly you need to amend the PYTHONPATH environment variable so that you can import janestreet. 
To do that you need something like export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)/input. 
It would be best to put this in .bashrc so it runs when you startup. Now you are at the Kaggle linux CLI and can wrote code in vim, emacs, whatever.
Alternatively, if you use VS Code (I do not), there is great integration with docker.

 You can run VS Code on your local operating system, but develop inside the container. https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers
