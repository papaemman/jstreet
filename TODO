[X] Set up development environment 

- Docker container on remote server 
- Local VScode and Jupyter notebooks with access in docker container running on remote server
- Create correct directory structure identical with kaggle environment
- Download dataset


[X] Develop a simple end-to-end ML solution


[] -----Make a simple submission from local development enviroment-----7
This is a Code competition!
This can't be accomplished, because for this competition the submission must be done from Kaggle Notebooks 

[] Understand prediction process
- How predict works? What is time-series API? What is janestreet generator?

[] Create a simple end-to-end submission Pipeline

- Add time counter fot submission using time series API.
- print counter
- What is the required time?

[] Implement evaluation metric

[] Setup ML experiment tracking process (wandb)

[] Setup Cross Validation scheme

[] Run some experiments and evaluate them unsing CV

[] Features Importance Analysis


===============
IDEAS
===============

- How can I use the features.csv dataset?

- How can I use lag features? Make a simple example.

- How can I make a new submission using a pre-trained model?
